## Description
This is a text editor that runs in the web browser but can be installed locally and used offline. It uses the webpack to bundle all the js/CSS/HTML files and create an efficient deployed site. (It uses plugins to help bundle the files and convert ES6+ code to ES5 code that is friendly for the browser.) It also uses the idb module to save the text to the indexedDB in the browser. I learned a lot about making efficient sites in this module by using webpack and the various plugins and service worker.

## Installation
My project can be installed from github. After installing it, run "npm install", then run "npm start". After you've created the build and the app is running in your browser, it can be installed.

## Usage
It can be used online/offline, but the important thing to note is that text is only saved after the text editor loses "focus". You must type out your text, then click on another page, app, etc. to make the app save the text you've typed.
